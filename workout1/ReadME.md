The primary goal of Workout 1 is to produce and work around a complex file structure with many directories and subdirectories. Upon completion, the project will be submitted to github to be graded. In terms of working with data, the homework serves to create shot charts for the Golden State Warriors starting 5. Shot charts will show every shot taken during the 2016-2017 season for a specific player and whether they made it or missed. Lastly, my findings will be put into a report, detailing what I discovered by making the shot charts.
